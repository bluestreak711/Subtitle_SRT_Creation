Srt files for chapters 15 and 16 were updated. Amor Real cap.15.srt had another chapter's srt saved over it by accident.
I regenerated the chapter's subtitles and corrected a few mistakes.

Chapter 36 opens up with somebody playing a guitar and singing.
The subtitles could not be generated for this portion and periods were put in the place of text.
The subtitles for the opening portion of this chapter needs to be added in manually by a native speaker.

Srt files for chapters 04 - 39 were uploaded.

A new entry for Amor Real was created. 
Posting exact source material is typically discouraged, but seems to be necessary in this case, so that time stamps will be accurate.
No download instructions for the content will be posted.
Captitulos 1 - 95 are being taken from the following playlist. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0PMOjmuFSQFWwSmW-BI9U9hIy8-FMaxK

Amor Real cap..58 was renamed to Amor Real cap.58. The original mistakenly had an extra dot in the title which caused the files not to be in order.
I added an extra 0 to Amor Real cap.1 through Amor Real cap.9 to make it Amor Real cap.01 through Amor Real cap.09 for better ordering.

So far, only the srt files for chapters 01 - 03 are uploaded.
