# Subtitle_SRT_Creation
##
DESCRIPTION: An effective method for language learning is consuming content with same language subtitles.
Unfortunately, subtitles seem to be lacking for content that is not in English. I hope we can change that together.
##
INTRODUCTION: 
I was enticed by the idea of Lingopie,
but the subscription program seems to
be expensive and rely on you being subscribed
to many other online paid subscription services.
##
MORE INFORMATION: 
A lot of people already know that there
are websites where you can download srt
(subtitle) files and bond them to the
content you already own such as movies,
tv shows and music. Unfortunately, srt
files seem to be lacking for content in
languages other than English. I believe
if there was a better supply of foreign
language srt files for media, language
learning content would be cheaper and
more available to the masses.
##
OTHER USE CASES FOR SRT FILES: 
Srt files contain the closed caption
data of audio and video files. SRT
files can be bonded, or burned into
corresponding video files, be used
to create lyrical videos and work as
closed captioning for audio files in
winamp and Plex Media Server. Outside
of the obvious uses, I think it would
be cool to create, generate and make
audio books in video formats that
display the text on screen.
##
I am not yet sure if the latter
will be in the scope of of this
particular github respository,
but we can leave it open for
discussion. My concern that the
inclusion of copyrighted books
could cause this project to get
nuked. The purpose in mentioning
the idea of captioned audio books
is to open your minds to the
possibilities and all the ways
SRT files can be used for language
learning.
##
PROJECT POLICY AND WORKFLOW: 
We wil not push video files to the Github
repository unless it is explicitly public
domain and even then, it will be to my best
discretion. In most cases, we will only be
pushing srt and txt files to the repository.
##
While uploading the content itself will be
discouraged, providing relevant information
about the content's origin will be encouraged.
##
For example, if the movie, or TV show, was
originally ripped from a DVD. Just list in
the readme file, of that particular content,
that it is a DVD rip. DO NOT INCLUDE ILLEGAL
DOWNLOAD LINKS. If the content was taken
from a particular YouTube, Daily Motion
etc... upload AND it is vital to the accuracy
of time stamps in the SRT file, I begrudgingly
agree that it may be necessary to share the
source of the content. HOWEVER, BE SURE TO
ONLY INCLUDE the LINK to the SOURCE and
NOT instruction for how to download and
obtain said content. We are ONLY providing
srt files, relevant txt files for updates
and public domain videos at my discretion.
##
Captions will be stored in SRT files and
each listing will have one txt file that
outlines what has been changed and adjusted
in each revision of the srt files in
to all other relevant information.
##
After an srt file has been revised, and
nearly perfected, any user can upload it
to one, or more, of the many websites that
host srt files, so it can be more widely
available to the masses.
